1.What is the importance of data visualization?
    Data visualization is important because it helps to present complex data in a simple and understandable way thats probaaly why we call it "ART OF VISUALIZATION" By turning numbers into visuals like charts and graphs, we can quickly understand patterns, trends, and outliers. 
2.When do you use a pie chart vs bar chart?
    Pie Chart: Use a pie chart when you want to show the proportion of parts to a whole. It's great for showing percentages or how different categories compare to the total.

         Example: Showing the percentage of market share for different companies.

    Bar Chart: Use a bar chart when you want to compare quantities across different categories. Itâ€™s better when you need to show actual numbers or differences between categories.
